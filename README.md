# CardDie-Game

<h1>Card & Dice Game</h1>
<h2>Object-Orientated Programming Coursework</h2>

<p>This project was mostly about implementing the factory design pattern to pick a card from a deck and roll and dice.
I can't remember what the game was exactly but it wasn't the focus of the actual coursework.</p>
